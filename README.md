# ReviewFaker

This project is self contained and should be able to run without further configuration. Open .../AmazonReviewFaker/AmazonReviewFaker.sln in Visual Studio 2022. The project uses .net 7 and entity core for an in-memory database. The main project can be run as either https or IIS Express. Once initialization completes, a browser should open and make a sample call to the endpoint.
